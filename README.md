This is my web development samester task according to requirements.
In this website, I have used navy and dark yellow colors. I have created sections in the website according to the navbar — meaning the sections are arranged in the same order as the navbar links. I have used a dropdown menu in the navbar because there are many links, but the sections are made line by line."
